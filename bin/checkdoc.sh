# This whole file is an utter hack to workaround some issues I've had by
# directly evaluating Lisp code into the Makefile and then trying to make
# something out of it. Mostly, apparently checkdoc-* functions do not emit a
# proper exit code, and trying to get the output out of it (plus the nightmarish
# situation with Makefile) has been impossible. Instead, we are going to do
# everything here in good ol' bash.
#
# This script is expected to be called with a list of arguments which are the
# parts of the command to be used. This command will be suffixed by this script
# with the Lisp code.
